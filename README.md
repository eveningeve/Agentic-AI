# Agentic-AI
Built a chat completion system with memory and multiple function calls (e.g., getWeather, getStockPrice) using OpenAI API/SDK, added streaming image generation, multimodal text-image input handling, and integrated tools like web/file search and text-to-speech into a unified AI agent with LangChain.
